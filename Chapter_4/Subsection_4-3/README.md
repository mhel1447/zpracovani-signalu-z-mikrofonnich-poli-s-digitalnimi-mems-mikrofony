This folder includes 3 folders and 2 scripts. Data measured by David Vágner, Jan Šedivý and David Ringsmuth are stored in folder [measurements_2023_07_27_14-44](Chapter_4/Subsection_4_3/measurement_2023-07-27_14-44) as part of David Vágners masters thesis ([link](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/111299)). DSB algorithm is applied in [Measurements_processing.py](Chapter_4/Subsection_4_3/Measurements_plotting.py) and the output data are stored in [Processed_recordings](Chapter_4/Subsection_4_3/Processed_recordings) folder. For plotting measurements beampatterns run script [Measurements_plotting.py](Chapter_4/Subsection_4_3/Measurements_processing.py) script, where you can specify frequencies for which the plots should be generated.

Folder [rendered_plots](Chapter_4/Subsection_4-3/rendered_plots) contains rendered plots used as an example in the thesis.
